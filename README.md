I developed this project during the nights of the second week of September/2016, after finishing the port of 
[Prince of Persia](https://github.com/lvcabral/Prince-of-Persia-Roku) as part of my studies about Roku Brightscript 2D gamming API.

There are four selectable options of sprites, the original Apple II, the Commodore 64, IBM-DOS CGA and Atari 8 bits.

There are three different level sets: the Classic (150 levels), Championship (50 levels) and Professional (150 levels). 
The level sets were converted from the [Javascript Lode Runner](https://github.com/SimonHung/LodeRunner_TotalRecall) project by Simon Hung.

Pending features: Original guards AI, sounds support, configure speed, high scores, save game and credits screen.
